            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Krishna Kriti, a passionate AWS Cloud Developer with experience in various technologies. I specialize in developing scalable and efficient cloud solutions using Amazon Web Services (AWS), GCP as well as Azure.

                My journey in software development started with Python and JavaScript, where I gained expertise in building web applications and RESTful APIs. I have a solid understanding of database management systems, including MongoDB, which enables me to design and optimize data models.
                
                Additionally, I have hands-on experience working with Docker, ensuring seamless deployment and management of applications in containerized environments. I have also implemented Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, to enable real-time data processing and event-driven architectures.
                
                My strong problem-solving skills and a passion for learning new technologies drive me to constantly explore and implement innovative solutions in the cloud space. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working on challenging projects that require creativity and attention to detail.
                
                I am continuously expanding my knowledge and keeping up with the latest trends in cloud computing to deliver reliable and efficient solutions for clients. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your cloud projects!</p>
